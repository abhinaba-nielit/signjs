# Browser-based ECDSA signing demo

This sample shows how to generate an ECDSA key pair completely in the browser, keep the private key on the client, upload only the public key to the server, and verify signatures with FastAPI.

## Running the demo

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to use the demo.

## Flow

1. Generate a key pair in the browser. Download and safely store the private key (it never leaves the browser).
2. Confirm the download and send the public key to the server. Only the last uploaded key is kept.
3. Select a data file and the previously saved private key to sign the data locally.
4. Submit the data and signature to the server. The server verifies them using the stored public key and reports if the signature is valid.
